### Nest + Angular Universal boilerplate

This is a simple boilerplate for a app using NestJS as backend and Angular Universal as frontend.

I created this boilerplate based on [This repository](https://github.com/colmena/angular-nest-universal-starter) that uses Universal, Nest and nrwl nx. Since I'm not familiar with nrwl nx, I made a boilerplate with only Nest and Universal, so I can use in my personal projects.

I'll continue to work on this boilerplate to make it better, but it already works.

It just shows a blank page with a text on it.

* npm build -> build the whole project
* npm start -> run the project with ts-node
* npm run start:dev -> run the project with nodemon (IMPORTANT: THE ANGULAR MUST BE BUILT ALREADY!)
* npm run start:prod -> run the compile project (from /dist)
* npm test -> run jest
